I may end up switching classes. I am already getting flashbacks from MMP 210 where I had actualy vowed to switch out of
Multimedia Programming. It's not the mistakes that I make that scare me. I just lose interest in very quickly. I know I'm creating what's in my head and that is what I want to do but I don't think programming may be my way of doing it.</p>

<p>I had barely scraped by in MMP 210, learning javascript through p5. Knowing that I can screw up a whole website by making a simple syntax error is intimidating and causes me to lose the interest. After switching back and forth between graphic arts and programming I can see what I prefer, but the problem is finding a job that will hire me for drawing rather than a job that involves programming which
    would probably pay more. </p>
